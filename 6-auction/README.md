# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`mocha` and `ethers`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using `mocha` for tests and the `ethers` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using `mocha` and ethers.js
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `mocha` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test mocha
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```




# Build a simple auction contract where users place bids using ETH.

The highest bidder wins when the auction ends.

Functional Requirements
1. Auction Setup
Owner sets:
startingPrice
auctionDuration

Auction starts immediately on deployment

2. Bidding
Anyone can bid by sending ETH
Bid must be higher than current highest bid
Previous highest bidder&apos;s ETH must be refundable

3. Ending the Auction
Auction ends after duration expires
Only owner can end the auction
Highest bidder wins
Owner receives the highest bid

4. Refunds
Outbid users must be able to withdraw their funds
No automatic refunds during bidding

Edge Cases to Handle
Bid after auction ends
Bid equal to highest bid
Ending auction twice
Owner bidding on own auction
