Practical Solidity smart contract projects demonstrating real-world Ethereum patterns, built with modern tooling such as Hardhat, Foundry, and EVM testing frameworks.

# Solidity Smart Contract Projects

This repository is a growing collection of production-style Solidity smart contracts focused on real-world Ethereum use cases and best practices.

Each project explores common on-chain patterns such as escrows, crowdfunding, auctions, savings mechanisms, and transactional flows, with an emphasis on correctness, security, and clean architecture. The codebase is structured to mirror real smart contract development workflows rather than isolated examples.

The projects are built and tested using modern Ethereum development frameworks and tooling, including **Hardhat**, **Foundry**, and **Ethers**, with room to evolve as the ecosystem advances.

### What this repository demonstrates
- Strong understanding of **Solidity and the EVM**
- Implementation of **real-world smart contract patterns**
- Use of **modern Ethereum tooling** (Hardhat, Foundry, Ethers)
- Focus on **clean code, modularity, and testability**
- Practical experience with **deployment, compilation, and project structuring**

This repository is intended as both a learning sandbox and a professional portfolio, showcasing hands-on experience with building, testing, and maintaining Ethereum smart contracts.
