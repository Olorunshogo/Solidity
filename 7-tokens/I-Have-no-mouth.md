# Words to Live By: &ldquo;I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream&rdquo; by Harlan Ellison


Within an hour of reading the story, there was a sort of pit in my stomach.

After lengthy details and sublime descriptions about the physical and mental torture of five human beings, I simply felt empty.

Harlan Ellison&apos;s short story &ldquo;I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream&rdquo; can only be described as diabolically dark.
So dark, in fact, that it manages to paint a more hopeless, bloody painting of agony than most stories.
It reads slowly, and there&apos;s no real action, but the unique characters and gnarly setting clawed into me like no other story has, and the short story inspired me like no lengthy novel has.

“I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” sets the story in the distant future, where a godlike supercomputer known simply as “AM” – which, after two iterations, stands for “Aggressive Menace – has managed to wipe the planet of all human life in a stroke of unfathomable loathing.
However, it kept five humans to satisfy its hatred by carrying out its own cruel amusement, torturing and spitting on the poor humans while somehow keeping them alive through the torment for hundreds of years.

The story is told from the perspective of Ted, a cynical man suffering from extreme paranoia who lives among an interesting crew of human shells, such as a once brilliant scientist turned unintelligent ape-man.
His account of the party&apos;s shambling journey to simply reach a rumored can of fruit, and their interaction with the despicable supercomputer, drive the trudging story.

No books or other short stories in my life can come close to telling such a melancholy story, with gloom oozing like tar from every paragraph.
With other depressing dystopian tales, such as “1984” or “Brave New World,” there are moments of rest from the depressing atmosphere.
Because “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” is shorter, it manages to suffocate the reader in hopelessness.
There&apos;s just so many damn terrible things happening that the story buries the reader in a tomb, with no glimmers of hope or happiness anywhere.

As the driving force for that awesome endless cycle of dread, AM stands as a villain that can only be described as evil.
Sure, when one reads about why the supercomputer despises humankind, they may sympathize with the artificial intelligence – slightly.
But the inhumane actions, both physical and mental, devised by the machine drive any sort of understanding out the window.

AM, truth be told, is the finest monster that I have ever read about.

It&apos;s the relationship between the computer and man that has impacted me since I read it.
The ending of the story, and AM&apos;s final decision, still gets to me. Most of all, though, it&apos;s that I still remember AM&apos;s incredibly powerful monologue of hatred toward humans.

This story not only makes me – among many others – feel hollow, especially after the great ending, but it also gives me superb inspiration.
As an overly hopeful writer of science fiction and horror, I have referred to Ellison&apos;s work time and time again. I hope someday, I will be able to make a world half as vile and horrifying as the one that “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” portrays.

But until that time in the far distant future comes, we will all have “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” to provide that unmatched macabre world and depressing tone.
